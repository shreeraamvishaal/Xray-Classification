# X-ray Image Classification Project ðŸ©»

This project is a **Deep Learning-powered X-ray Image Classification Project** that classifies Chest X-ray images to detect whether the lungs are healthy or affected by pneumonia.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used for training the model was sourced from Kaggle. It consists of chest X-ray images for both healthy lungs and pneumonia cases.

- **Normal Chest X-rays**: 1341 images
- **Pneumonia Chest X-rays**: 3875 images
